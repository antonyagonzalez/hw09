#' hw09: a mini R package by antonyagonzalez
#'
#' The following package is an excerpt of a larger package I am working on focusing on
#' making regression coefficients easier to deal with. Looking over regression output
#' and trying to extract what you need from it can be quite the headache, especially if
#' you have many different models to deal with. This mini package will extract betas
#' and their relevant statistics from 3 way interaction regression models to get
#' information for a 2 way interaction between your 1st and 2nd predictor (interact12),
#' information for the 3 way interaction (interact3), and will meta-analyze standardized
#' regression coefficients that you input.
